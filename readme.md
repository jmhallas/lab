# General idea on how to organize this repository

## Directories for different types of analyses

At the top level, lets keep things organized by having directories for different types of workflows. In the directories for each workflow, lets keep the more detailed and polished markdown pages. These would ideally be developed enough to share with a course or with other researchers for teaching/collaboration purposes.

At this level, lets also have directories for each lab member. In these directories, lets store less polished, but still useful markdown pages, example code, useful pdfs, etc.
